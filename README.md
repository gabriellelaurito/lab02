# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
 *object- Things that have states and behaviors. They are part of a class.
 *class- A class is the blueprint that describes the states and behaviors of the object.
 *instance- Detailed information about one particular object. (ex. Details about your specific car would be the instance of the class “Cars”).
 *method- A set of code that can be called on by the program. Usually returns a value.
 *signature- Provides the information needed to invoke a method. 
 *parameter- The additional values that some methods require.
 *type- Defines what kind of values a parameter can take.
 *state- The set of values for all attributes defining an object. 
 *source code- A set of instructions that can make a program.
 *return value- The value type that the method will return. 
 *compiler- A program that reads source code and translates it into a language the computer can read.

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

0 -int
 +* "hello"-string
 +* 101 -int
 +* -1 -int
 +* true -boolean
 +* "33" -string
 +* 3.1415 -double

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
Under public class Circle add the line private string name;
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
public void send (String a)
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
public int average (int 1, int 2)
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
It is an object. It’s class is texts. 
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
No, an object can only have one class, but it can have many interfaces.
